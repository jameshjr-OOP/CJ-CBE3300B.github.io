    A pulseometer is a wearable device to measure a user's real-time heart rate.
    Pulseometers are commonplace for use in both medical settings and at-home
    patient care. Commercial pulseometers measure heart rate (bpm) and peripheral
    blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂). These measurements are useful for everyday
    health monitoring, particularly for patients with conditions affecting the
    lungs or heart.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
    Using the principles of photoplethysmography, this device detects subtle
    flushing that occurs when blood flows through capillaries near the surface
    of the skin. Through signal processing, this information is converted into
    a real-time heart rate. Oxygen saturation is outside the scope of this
    project but may be considered in future iterations.

    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
		Challenges in producing an effective & accurate pulsometer relate to understanding the interaction of light 
		with human skin tissue, small signals with a large amount of background noise, user interaction with the equipment. 
	</p>
		
	<p style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
		The focus point for our device is the finger, yet even the composition of the finger is very complex and tissue properties 
		vary widely from person to person. In our device, light must travel through every skin layer (epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis), 
		then through muscle, fascia, nerve tissue, and other connective tissue. Our device should be able to function regardless of skin color 
		(as melanin content can change refractive behavior of light), fat content, or muscle content. While the patient is using the device, 
		it should still be able to function under differing conditions of fingertip perspiration, slight finger movement, or changing external 
		lighting conditions. We plan to account for these differences by using wavelengths of light that work regardless of skin absorbers (like melanin) 
		and target the absorption spectra of oxygenated blood. We will account for friendly user design by using a finger clip that will block out external 
		light sources and will grip tight enough to not be affected by user movement, but not so tight that it cuts off blood flow.
	</p>
		
	<p style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
		A challenge we faced in CBE 3300A when creating a rudimentary pulsometer is making a small signal amplified and removing background signal and 
		noise. The flushing of the skin that we are trying to detect is very minor, and creating a device to measure these slight changes could be 
		likened to finding a needle in a haystack. There are many sources of background signal and noise for PPG, but absorption from other tissues, 
		background light, and user movement were the largest. However, these factors generally do not change for an individual user while they are using 
		the device, so it tends to result in a baseline DC signal that we have to filter out. What is important is making sure the signal is able to stand 
		out after we remove everything else. We plan to deal with this by implementing new circuit design and signal processing techniques.

  <!-- Circuit Design & Signal Processing -->

	<hr style="border: none; border-top: 2px solid black; margin: 0.75rem 0 1.5rem 0;">
	  
    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
		This circuit is made up of four components. Going left to right, the first component is the finger cuff, 
		this is where the patient interacts with the device. The finger cuff will be in the shape of a finger 
		clip, with the IR LED and the photodiode positioned on opposite sides of the finger. The photodiode 
		converts light into electrical current with a high sensitivity and linearity, which is helpful for the 
		small signals we are working with. The second component is the transimpedance amplifier (TIA). The current 
		from the photodiode flows to the negative terminal of the op-amp and through the gain-setting resistor. 
		This creates a voltage at the output of the op-amp that is proportional to the input current - the capacitor 
		helps reduce noise. Next is a simple highpass filter; we are removing the DC baseline signal that comes from 
		the natural absorbance and scattering from the tissue. The last component is a non-inverting gain op-amp. 
		This amplifies the signal by a factor of R2/R1 (the ratio of the resistor in the feedback loop to the resistor 
		connected to ground). The capacitor in this stage blocks the DC signal that we added in the previous stage,
		amplifying only the AC signal that we care about.
	</p>
		
	<p style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
		The goal of this whole process is to isolate the signal we care about (absorbance from oxygenated hemoglobin) 
		and amplify it while removing background signal / noise. In this circuit there is already signal processing
		with multiple built-in filters, but there is more signal processing that has to happen in arduino. In order 
		to remove background noise from the environment, we can use background subtracted signal. We blink the IR LED
		on and off (50-500Hz) and measure the signal in the on versus off state. Subtracting these two values will give
		us a reading that is roughly independent of the surrounding conditions - like ambient lighting or different 
		placements of the device on the finger. Furthermore, in order to give a heart rate in bpm, it is necessary to 
		real-time peak detection on the signal. This peak detection becomes very hard with noisy signal, but assuming 
		we can tune our filter appropriately, this peak detection can be done with a simple cut off. If the signal is 
		higher than some predetermined baseline and the signal goes from increasing to decreasing (instantaneous derivative = 0) 
		then we can mark a peak. Time average between peaks gives the users real-time bpm.

    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
		The global market for wearable healthcare devices is projected to increase by $75.98 billion 
		by 2030, representing a 67.76% increase over its 2025 value. Over this forecast period, the 
		market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.9%. This shows the 
		demand for wearable healthcare devices will continue to grow. This market includes devices that 
		measure pulse, blood-oxygen levels, glucose, insulin, and more with the purpose of focusing on 
		this market because there isn’t an explicit pulsometer market, only a pulse oximeter market. 
		For the SWOT analysis, we have identified the following:
	</p>

	<p style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
		Strength: Our product only has one feature and so our focus is to have the pulse readings more accurate 
		than other products. 
	</p>

	<p style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
		Weakness: Since we are using an arduino, the product will be more clunky to wear. 
	</p>

	<p style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
		Opportunity: general health awareness amongst people is rising, making it more likely our product will sell.
	</p>

	<p style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
		Threat: Most pulsometers on the market also function as an oximeter, making our product have less features than 
		competitors.

    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
		The goal of this project is to create a commercially viable pulseometer, but in order 
		to do this faithfully we would need to include blood oximetry measurements, as previously 
		mentioned. In order to do this we would need a second LED of a lower wavelength (in the visible red spectrum) 
		and we would need to process that second signal in real time, same as the IR signal. With a device using this 
		dual-LED set up, we could measure far more complex bodily functions, like sleep tracking workout activity, 
		similar to products like a fitbit or apple watch. 
	</p>

	<p style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
		Another goal would be to improve the user experience. The circuit described above will be bulky, and therefore 
		difficult to take on the go. If we could miniaturize this circuit on a printed circuit board, and use a much 
		smaller microcontroller, then we could embed the device entirely onto the finger clip, and use bluetooth to 
		communicate with a computer or a phone. Depending on project progress, we would love to try incorporating some 
		or all of these in order to make a more commercially viable product.
